Web Application Sitemap,info,"Publishes the sitemap of the web application as seen by the scan.

The list of all URLs that have been detected during the scan are available as an attachment. For each URL in the sitemap, the following information is provided:

- The first time the URL is detected - The logic used to detect the URL. This information may be found by: crawling rendering the page by a specific plugin - The parent URL requested to detect the URL - If the URL has been requested at least once, information about the response - Whether or not the URL has been queued for audit - If the URL has not been queued for audit, the reason why the URL does not need an audit - Whether or not the URL has been effectively audited - If the URL has not been effectively audited, the reason that the scanner was unable to audit the URL


Reasons for not adding a URL to the audit queue are as follows:

- not_in_domain: The domain of the URL does not match main target URL - scope_configuration: The URL does not match scope include list scan settings - directory_depth: The number of directories in the URL path exceeds the scan configuration setting - exclude_file_extension: The URL file extension matched one entry of the file extension blacklist setting - exclude_path_patterns: The URL matched one entry of the URL exclusion blacklist setting - redundant_path: The number of URLs to be audited with the same path and query string parameters has been reached - request_redirect_limit: The number of HTTP redirects allowed per scan configuration setting has been reached - queue_full: The number of URLs to audit has been reached


If a scan fails to audit a URL that has been queued for audit, reasons for the failure are as follows:

- timeout: The request timed out when trying to retrieve URL contents - filesize_exceeded: URL response exceeded file size limit defined in the scan configuration - scan_timelimit_reached: The URL couldnâ€™t be audited before the scan time limit - user_abort: The user stopped the scan before the URL could be audited",General,https://<REACTED>-staging1-app.<REACTED>.com,https://cloud.tenable.com/was/v2/attachments/b10b5886-7d65-4696-bb68-846a3de49189
